## The goal of this project is to create a game in 3D using raycasting !
This was designed for kids so that it could improve their spatial recognition and analytical skills

## Keyboard Keys for Players
`Arrow Keys` -- Player Directions, 
`R` -- Refresh, 
`M` -- Map, 
`C` -- Zoom Player view, 
`[` -- Zoom Out in Game, 
`]` -- Zoom In in Game, 
`F` -- Change Views (Normal view to Panoramic view and vice versa), 
`T` -- Change Texture of walls and square columns, 

### <u>Tools and Languages Used...</u>
- C language
- SDL2 (Simple Directmedia Layer)
- Ray-Casting
- Bash
- Makefile

## Compiling
Using a Windows Operating sysytem, Navigate to the `src` folder and Compile with 
`gcc -std=c17 *.c -I{Path to SDL2\include} -L{Path to SDL2\lib} -Wall -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -o raycaster`
